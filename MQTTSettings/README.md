## IoT MQTT Settings File
Copy the "IoTMQTTPanelXXXXX.json file above to your phone, then open the IoT MQTT Panel app.  I find the easiest way to get the file on your phone is to email it to yourself and download it that way.  Use the hamburger menu then click "Backup and Restore".  Click on "Restore" and select this fil e from your downloads.  Next, you will need to setup your connection.  From the main screen hamburger menu, click on "All Connections" then select the ellipsis menu.  Click on the pencil (edit) and change the broker address from 192.168.0.195 to the IP address of your Seadata2000 board.  The port should be defaulted correctly to 1883 and the network protocol is "TCP".  The Client Id doesn't matter and can be left blank.
