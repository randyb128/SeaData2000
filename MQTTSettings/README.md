# IoT MQTT Settings File
Copy this file to your phone, then use the IoT MQTT Panel app.  Use the hamburger menu then "Backup and Restore".  Click on "Restore" and select this file from your downloads.  Next, you will need to setup your connection.  From the main screen hamburger menu, click on "All Connections" then select the ellipsis menu.  Click on the pencil (edit) and change the broker address to the IP address of your Seadata2000 board.  The port should be defaulted correctly to 1883 and the network protocol is "TCP".  The Client Id doesn't matter and can be left blank.
